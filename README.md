# Computational-Sociology
This repository hosts a database containing the main scientific articles that have applied computational techniques or digital data in empirical sociological research. The database is continuously updated and expanded, with the aim of fostering a collaborative effort. If you know of articles that meet the inclusion criteria, feel free to contribute and help us grow this resource.

## Inclusion Criteria

The database includes **scientific publications** that conduct **empirical investigations** focused on the analysis of **social phenomena**.

To be part of the database, articles must meet **all** of the following criteria:

- Apply one or more **emerging computational techniques**, such as:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Topic modeling (e.g., LDA, BERTopic)
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Network analysis
  - Machine learning algorithms (e.g., clustering, classification)
  - Deep learning or neural networks
  - Agent-based modeling or simulation

- And/or use **digital data sources**, such as:
  - Social media platforms (Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram)
  - Online forums, blogs or comment sections
  - Mobile phone metadata or GPS traces
  - Streaming platforms (YouTube, Spotify, Netflix)
  - App usage data
  - Web-scraped content from websites or platforms

- Be **empirical** (i.e., based on data and analysis rather than purely theoretical)
- Include a valid **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)**

Studies from any discipline are welcome as long as they provide insights relevant to sociology or the empirical study of social life.
